		'auth.reject' => 'array',	# default: (null)

		# This specifies the number of self-heals that can be performed in background without blocking the fop
		'cluster.background-self-heal-count' => 'integer',	# default: 16

		# Choose a local subvolume (i.e. Brick) to read from if read-subvolume is not explicitly set.
		'cluster.choose-local' => 'truefalse',	# default: true

		# Data fops like write/truncate will not perform pre/post fop changelog operations in afr transaction if this option is disabled
		'cluster.data-change-log' => 'onoff',	# default: on

		# Using this option we can enable/disable data self-heal on the file. "open" means data self-heal action will only be triggered by file open operations.
		'cluster.data-self-heal' => 'onoff',	# default: on

		# Select between "full", "diff". The "full" algorithm copies the entire file from source to sink. The "diff" algorithm copies to sink only those blocks whose checksums don't match with those of source. If no option is configured the option is chosen dynamically as follows: If the file does not exist on one of the sinks or empty file exists or if the source file size is about the same as page size the entire file will be read and written i.e "full" algo, otherwise "diff" algo is chosen.
		'cluster.data-self-heal-algorithm' => 'string',	# default: (reset)

		# Lock phase of a transaction has two sub-phases. First is an attempt to acquire locks in parallel by broadcasting non-blocking lock requests. If lock acquisition fails on any server, then the held locks are unlocked and revert to a blocking locked mode sequentially on one server after another. If this option is enabled the initial broadcasting lock request attempt to acquire lock on the entire file. If this fails, we revert back to the sequential "regional" blocking lock as before. In the case where such an "eager" lock is granted in the non-blocking phase, it gives rise to an opportunity for optimization. i.e, if the next write transaction on the same FD arrives before the unlock phase of the first transaction, it "takes over" the full file lock. Similarly if yet another data transaction arrives before the unlock phase of the "optimized" transaction, that in turn "takes over" the lock as well. The actual unlock now happens at the end of the last "optimized" transaction.
		'cluster.eager-lock' => 'onoff',	# default: on
