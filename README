puppet-gluster, by James Shubin <james@shubin.ca>, https://ttboj.wordpress.com/

WARNING: This module is in development phase, and things might change drastically. You've been warned. Sorry about any ugliness that is present at the moment.

DEPENDENCIES: This module (optionally) depends on my unreleased puppet-shorewall module.

PATCHES - should be submitted as pull requests
DISCUSSION - are encouraged as github issues

USAGE:
Put these two folders in your $PUPPET_MODULE_DIR/gluster/
Configure your nodes... (All server nodes should have identical puppet config)
Profit!!!
